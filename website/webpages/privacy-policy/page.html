<h2>5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
<strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</em></div>
<div>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</div>
<div>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</div>
<div>
<h2>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></div>
<div>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us .</div>
<div>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</div>
<div>
<h2>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
<strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</em></div>
<div>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent&rsquo;s use of the Services.
